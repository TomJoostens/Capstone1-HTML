            This is me. My name is Tom Joostens and I recently gradueted in a professional bachelor.<br/>
            At the moment I am working in insurance at AG Insurance, but this is not my dream job.<br/>
            My dream job is creating something with code. At the moment I don't know yet if I want to make <br/>
            websites or apps or use AI to create amazing things. I just know I want to do something with this.<br/>
            So now I am currently learning how to code and it's exciting. I really want to see where I can go with this.<br/>
